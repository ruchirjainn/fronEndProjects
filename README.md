I, Ruchir Jain, am an engineering student currently studying at Swami Vivekananda College of Engineering. I am passionate about learning, particularly in the areas of computer science and software development. With a strong drive for personal growth and a commitment to academic excellence, I am confident in my ability to contribute to the field of engineering and achieve my career aspirations.

This repository contains front-end projects built using HTML and CSS only. The projects included are replicas of the front pages of popular websites like Apple India, Netflix, and Amazon.

I would like to acknowledge the contribution of GreatStack for their valuable tutorial on creating the front-end designs for the Amazon and Netflix projects. Their tutorial provided helpful guidance and inspiration for building these replicas. I highly recommend checking out their channel for more amazing web development tutorials and resources.
